All code used by students, instructors, and other faculty from the past, current, and future should be readily, but voluntarily, available to the jh-gh-community

We’ll focus on three languages for the following reasons:
1. Entrenched usage of the commercially available Stata
2. Open-source & free availability of R & Python
3. GPT-4o yields very accurate code for python (usage data)

Most of what is done is Stata labs can be encoded into a brief Jupter-book, with code in Python, R, and Stata 

####  Dionysus 
- Challenges (honestly, unselectively embrace past, current, future)  
- Skills (table 1, figure 1, grants, databases)
- Tools (python, ai, r, stata)

####  Sing O Muse
- Jupyter-book series on GitHub (Six)

####  Apollo 
- Iterate-dynamically-collaboratively 
- By students & instructors at both SOM & JHSPH  

```{admonition} Top Tip
:class: tip
*Let's iterate, dynamically, collaboratively ..., openly*
```

In the {ref}`Foreword Section<fw>` of this book, we provide meta-level information about _The Turing Way_, including guidance on how to use and navigate this project, how to cite the book and opportunities to get involved.

The book is collaboratively written and built in the open from the start.
You can explore different opportunities to get involved on the [start page](https://the-turing-way.start.page/).
Join [our Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/theturingway/shared_invite/zt-fn608gvb-h_ZSpoA29cCdUwR~TIqpBw) to connect and discuss your ideas and [subscribe to our newsletter](https://buttondown.email/turingway) to follow updates from our community.

## Varous Pathways

(welcome-community)=
## Our Community

_The Turing Way_ community is dedicated to making collaborative, reusable and transparent research "too easy not to do".
That means investing in the socio-technical skills required to work in a team, to build something more significant than any individual could deliver alone.

_JH on GH_ is:

* a book series
* a community
* a [global](https://jhufena.github.io/home/intro.html) collaboration

```{admonition} Translation
