## Claude 3.5 Sonnet

Didn't have to go beyond **step 2** below: copying & pasting into `requirements.txt`

```sh
cd ~/documents/liveserver/cnd/book/website
pip install -r requirements.txt && jupyter-book build .
mv project-design/app _build/html/project-design/app
cd ~/documents/liveserver
new/jbb_https.sh
```

I apologize for the confusion. It seems the issue is more complex than initially thought. The error you're encountering is related to numpy installation, which is failing due to compatibility issues with your Python version.

Given that you're using Python 3.12 (as evident from the error message), there are a few things we need to consider:

1. numpy 1.24.4 is not compatible with Python 3.12. The latest version of numpy that supports Python 3.12 is 1.26.0 or newer.

2. Some of the other packages in your requirements might also have compatibility issues with Python 3.12.

Here's what I suggest:

1. Update numpy in your requirements.txt:
   Change `numpy==1.24.4` to `numpy>=1.26.0`

2. For other packages, it's better to specify minimum versions rather than exact versions to allow for compatibility. Here's a revised version of the requirements that should work better:

3. After updating your requirements.txt, try these steps:
   
   a. Delete your virtual environment and create a new one:
      ```
      rm -rf myenv
      python3.12 -m venv myenv
      source myenv/bin/activate
      ```

   b. Upgrade pip:
      ```
      pip install --upgrade pip
      ```

   c. Install the requirements:
      ```
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

   d. If you still encounter issues, try installing packages one by one to identify which one is causing problems.

If you still face issues after these changes, please provide the new error message, and I'll be happy to help further.

### Configuration

- The table of contents (TOC) defines the order of chapters as they appear in the book.
To change the TOC, please edit the `website/_toc.yml` file with correct information on filenames and their relative locations in this repository.
Documentation on controlling the TOC structure can be found on the [Jupyter Book website](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/toc.html).
- Same applies for more general configuration using `website/_config.yml`.
Documentation on configuring book settings can be found on the [Jupyter Book website](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html).

### Deploying

The site is built automatically using these two directories. All of the requirements are specified in `website/requirements.txt`.

Instructions for how to build a Turing Way book locally can be found in [_The Turing Way_'s Community Handbook](https://book.the-turing-way.org/community-handbook/local-build).

#### On Netlify

_The Turing Way_ book is built and deployed online using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

If you want to deploy the book on Netlify, you'll need the following settings:

- Base directory: `book/website`
- Build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt && jupyter-book build .`
- Publish directory: `book/website/_build/html`

Netlify is smart and will find your requirements.txt to do the install for you. :slightly_smiling_face:

You can find the build history or logs for _The Turing Way_ at https://app.netlify.com/sites/the-turing-way/deploys.

## Bibliography

In the directory `./website/_bibliography` a collection of bibliography from all the chapters exist in the `references.bib` file.
More details can be read in the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/the-turing-way/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#referencing-and-citing) file.

## Content Templates

Templates for different types of content can be created in the [`templates` directory](./templates).

As of now, the template directory includes the following:
* `case-study-template`: a template for writing and/or revising case studies
* `chapter-template`: a template for writing new chapters or revising old ones

The template can be copied to create content relevant to a chapter in the `content` directory.
